# ACA
Augmented Classifier Attack

What is ACA?
Generative algorithm, that can generate images, with support of any image classifier
It doesn't need image generators
It optimizes input image space "directly", optimizing it using augmentation, to match given classifier output
It can help researchers to optimize their image classifiers
It is highly recommended to run this Colab notebook with GPU backend
